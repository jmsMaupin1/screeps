1. creeps have a ticksToLive prop. We can take advantage of these in a few ways
    a. check to see if the creep has enough ticks left to live and complete its
        current task. If not make it suicide. Check this every time it needs
        to go back to get energy to make sure we dont waste energy
    
    b. Have the spawner check each creep to see how long it has to live, when
        one is about to die start spawning another creep to replace it.

2. in order to find the source with the shortest path between the object we are
    transporting energy to and an energy source we will need to use the
    findPathTo function: https://docs.screeps.com/api/#RoomPosition.findPathTo
    this function will return an array with the shortest path from one object
    to another. We need to computer the distance between every point and sum 
    them to find the total length of a path to determine the shortest path to
    an energy source.

3. We need to do some load balancing between energy sources, it looks like
    only maybe 2 creeps can harvest at a time? Need to do more research
    there should be 1 harvester per energy source thats not a container,
    it should drop the energy directly into a container where other creeps
    can the grab energy  from the bucket. We want the harvesters/miners to be
    able to have a ton of work parts. Shouldnt need many move parts since once
    the get to their destination they should basicallynever move.
